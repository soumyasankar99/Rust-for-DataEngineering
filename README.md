# Rust for Data Engineering

Welcome to **Rust for Data Engineering**, a repository dedicated to exploring the power of Rust in data engineering tasks. This project is structured to help data engineers learn and leverage Rust’s high performance, concurrency, and memory safety for ETL, data transformation, real-time processing, and more.

## Introduction
Rust has become increasingly popular in the field of data engineering, thanks to its speed, safety, and concurrency. This repository covers a wide range of data engineering concepts, including ETL pipelines, data transformation, and real-time data ingestion, using Rust's robust ecosystem of libraries like **Polars** for data manipulation, **Serde** for serialization, and **Tokio** for asynchronous tasks.

## Features
- **Efficient ETL Pipelines**: Ingest, transform, and load data to destinations like databases and cloud storage.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using Polars, a fast and powerful data manipulation library similar to Pandas.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Real-time data ingestion and processing with Redis and Kafka.
- **Concurrency and Async I/O**: Handle high data loads with Rust’s async capabilities using Tokio.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Rust fundamentals, especially modules, ownership, and error handling.

### Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soumyasankar99/rust-for-data-engineering.git
cd rust-for-data-engineering
```

### Setting Up Dependencies
Add required libraries by editing `Cargo.toml` or running:

```bash
cargo add polars serde tokio
```

Then, build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Modules

### 1. **Data Ingestion (`src/data_ingestion`)**
   - Handles data extraction from various sources like files, APIs, and databases.
   - Supports formats like CSV, JSON, and more with `serde` and `csv` crates.

### 2. **Data Transformation (`src/data_transformation`)**
   - Contains functions for data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation using **Polars**.
   - Optimized for handling large datasets and performing complex transformations.

### 3. **Data Loading (`src/data_loading`)**
   - Supports loading data into destinations such as MongoDB, Redis, and S3.
   - Asynchronous I/O for handling large data loads efficiently with Tokio.

### 4. **Real-Time Processing (`src/real_time_processing`)**
   - Integrates with Redis and Kafka to handle real-time data ingestion and streaming.
   - Ideal for streaming ETL tasks and event-driven pipelines.

### 5. **Utilities (`src/utils`)**
   - Helper functions for error handling, logging, and configuration.

## Usage

### Running a Basic ETL Pipeline
To demonstrate the basic ETL process, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example etl_pipeline
```

This script ingests sample CSV data, applies transformations using Polars, and loads it to a local database.

### Example: Real-Time Data Processing
To simulate real-time data processing:

```bash
cargo run --example real_time_processing
```

This example pulls data from Redis, processes it, and sends it to another endpoint.

## Examples
Find detailed examples in the `examples/` directory:
- **ETL Pipeline Example**: Covers CSV ingestion, data cleaning, and loading to MongoDB.
- **Real-Time Processing Example**: Shows Kafka integration for streaming and processing real-time data.
- **Data Transformation Example**: Walks through data filtering, joining, and aggregations using Polars.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Please make sure to write tests for new features and document any changes.

## FAQ
**Q: Why use Rust for data engineering?**  
A: Rust provides unmatched performance, memory safety, and concurrency, making it ideal for scalable, high-performance data processing tasks.

**Q: How can I add new data sources or destinations?**  
A: You can add new modules under `src/data_ingestion` or `src/data_loading` for specific data sources or destinations.

**Q: How do I handle errors in Rust?**  
A: We use `Result` and `Option` types for error handling, ensuring robust error management throughout the ETL process.

## Anything Else
At the heart of every data transformation and processing pipeline is a desire for speed and efficiency. Rust empowers us to build data pipelines that are not only fast but also robust and safe. We hope this repository inspires data engineers to embrace Rust's potential and explore the new heights it brings to data engineering.

Happy coding, and let’s make data fly with Rust!
