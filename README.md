## ✨ Introduction
Rust’s reputation as a safe, high-performance systems language is well-deserved. This project explores Rust’s strengths in data engineering, covering ETL pipelines, real-time data processing, and complex data transformations with libraries like **Polars**, **Serde**, and **Tokio**.

## 🎯 Features
- 🚀 **Efficient ETL Pipelines**: Ingest, transform, and load data into destinations like MongoDB or S3.
- 🧩 **Data Transformation**: Utilize **Polars** for fast, powerful data manipulation.
- 🔥 **Real-Time Processing**: Real-time ingestion with Redis and Kafka.
- 🧵 **Concurrency**: Leverage async tasks to handle high data loads with ease.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 💻 Installation

Rust can be installed across different operating systems as described below:

#### From the Official Site
1. Head to [Rust's Official Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and download the installer.
2. Follow the prompts to set up Rust, Cargo, and related tools.
3. Confirm installation by running:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

#### Quick Install via Shell
For any Unix-like system (Linux or macOS), you can install Rust directly using the Rustup installer script:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installation by OS

- **Windows**:
   1. Download and install Rust using [rustup-init.exe](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe).
   2. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
      ```powershell
      rustup-init.exe
      ```
   3. After installation, close and reopen your terminal to ensure Cargo (Rust’s package manager) is added to your PATH.
   
- **macOS**:
   1. You can use the shell command above or install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
      ```bash
      brew install rustup
      rustup-init
      ```
   2. To update Rust and Cargo paths, add this to your shell profile:
      ```bash
      export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
      ```
   
- **Linux**:
   - Most Linux distributions support Rust installation with the shell command. If you prefer using a package manager:
      - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
         ```bash
         sudo apt update
         sudo apt install rustc
         ```
      - **Fedora**:
         ```bash
         sudo dnf install rust
         ```
   - To ensure Cargo is in your path, add:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
     ```

### Running with Docker
If you prefer Docker, you can use the official Rust image:

1. Pull the Rust image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull rust
   ```
2. Run Rust commands in a container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm rust:latest
   ```
3. To build and run your Rust projects in Docker, mount the project directory:
   ```bash
   docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp rust cargo build
   ```

### Updating Rust
Keep Rust up to date with:
```bash
rustup update
```

### ⚙️ Configuration & Hardware

- **Memory Requirements**: Rust is efficient, but at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for data processing tasks.
- **CPU Compatibility**: Ensure your system supports modern instructions (e.g., SSE4) for data processing with Polars.
- **Environment Variables**: Add Cargo to your PATH, typically done by Rustup during installation.

## 📚 Modules

1. **Data Ingestion (`src/data_ingestion`)** 🗃️
   - Ingest data from files, APIs, and databases using **Serde**.

2. **Data Transformation (`src/data_transformation`)** 🔄
   - Transform data with filtering, joining, and aggregation using **Polars**.

3. **Data Loading (`src/data_loading`)** 🗄️
   - Load data into MongoDB, Redis, and S3 with async I/O.

4. **Real-Time Processing (`src/real_time_processing`)** ⏱️
   - Stream and process data with Kafka and Redis.

5. **Utilities (`src/utils`)** 🛠️

## ❓ FAQ

### Important Things to Remember While Using Rust
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust’s strict ownership model helps avoid memory errors. Check out the [Rust Ownership documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
- **Concurrency with Tokio**: Use the `#[tokio::main]` attribute for async functions and wrap I/O tasks in `tokio::spawn`.
- **Error Handling**: Rust uses `Result` and `Option` types for error handling. [Anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/) and [ThisError](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) are also popular for structured error handling.
- **Macros and Pattern Matching**: Rust’s macros like `match` and `if let` provide powerful control flows and are integral in clean error handling.

## 📈 Rust's Journey and Why It Matters for Data Engineers

### Rust's Development Over the Years
Since its initial release, Rust has grown rapidly, earning a reputation for performance and safety, and consistently topping developer surveys for most-loved language. As of now, Rust has reached a maturity level that makes it an ideal choice for system-level and high-performance applications, with key improvements in error handling, async programming, and stable libraries.

### Why Rust Is a Game-Changer for Data Engineers
Rust’s focus on performance, memory safety, and zero-cost abstractions makes it uniquely suited for data engineering:
1. **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Rust’s async model and Tokio library make it easy to handle large-scale data tasks.
2. **Reliability**: Rust’s strict compile-time checks minimize runtime errors, crucial for data integrity.
3. **Scalability**: Data engineers can build pipelines that handle increasing data loads with minimal memory footprint.

For data engineers who want to push the limits of efficiency and reliability, Rust offers tools to build pipelines that are faster, safer, and more scalable than traditional languages.

## 📌 Anything Else

Data is growing exponentially, and handling it demands both speed and precision. Rust
