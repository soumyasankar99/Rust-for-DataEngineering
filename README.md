## 🎯 Features
- 🚀 **Efficient ETL Pipelines**: Ingest, transform, and load data into destinations like MongoDB or S3.
- 🧩 **Data Transformation**: Utilize **Polars** for fast, powerful data manipulation.
- 🔥 **Real-Time Processing**: Real-time ingestion with Redis and Kafka.
- 🧵 **Concurrency**: Leverage async tasks to handle high data loads with ease.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 💻 Installation

Rust can be installed across different operating systems as described below:

#### From the Official Site
1. Head to [Rust's Official Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and download the installer.
2. Follow the prompts to set up Rust, Cargo, and related tools.
3. Confirm installation by running:
   <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
   rustc --version</code></pre>

#### Quick Install via Shell
For any Unix-like system (Linux or macOS), you can install Rust directly using the Rustup installer script:
<pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh</code></pre>

#### Installation by OS

- **Windows**:
   1. Download and install Rust using [rustup-init.exe](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe).
   2. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
      <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>powershell
      rustup-init.exe</code></pre>
   3. After installation, close and reopen your terminal to ensure Cargo (Rust’s package manager) is added to your PATH.
   
- **macOS**:
   1. You can use the shell command above or install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
      <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
      brew install rustup
      rustup-init</code></pre>
   2. To update Rust and Cargo paths, add this to your shell profile:
      <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
      export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"</code></pre>
   
- **Linux**:
   - Most Linux distributions support Rust installation with the shell command. If you prefer using a package manager:
      - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
         <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
         sudo apt update
         sudo apt install rustc</code></pre>
      - **Fedora**:
         <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
         sudo dnf install rust</code></pre>
   - To ensure Cargo is in your path, add:
     <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
     export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"</code></pre>

### Running with Docker
If you prefer Docker, you can use the official Rust image:

1. Pull the Rust image from Docker Hub:
   <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
   docker pull rust</code></pre>
2. Run Rust commands in a container:
   <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
   docker run -it --rm rust:latest</code></pre>
3. To build and run your Rust projects in Docker, mount the project directory:
   <pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
   docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp rust cargo build</code></pre>

### Updating Rust
Keep Rust up to date with:
<pre class="overflow-x-auto"><code>bash
rustup update</code></pre>

### How to run File(s) in Rust !!!

### 1. Running a Rust File with Cargo

Cargo is the recommended way to compile and run Rust projects because it handles dependencies and project structure easily.

1. **Initialize a New Cargo Project**:
   ```bash
   cargo new project_name
   cd project_name
   ```

2. **Write Code**: Edit the `src/main.rs` file to add your code.

3. **Run the Code**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   This will build and run your Rust project. Cargo compiles the project, resolves dependencies, and caches the build files in the `target` directory.

### 2. Running a Single Rust File with `rustc`

If you only have a single Rust file and don’t need a full Cargo project, you can use the `rustc` command directly:

1. **Compile the File**:
   ```bash
   rustc filename.rs
   ```

   This will create an executable in the same directory.

2. **Run the Executable**:
   - On **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     ./filename
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     filename.exe
     ```

### Example
If you have a file named `hello.rs` with the following code:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

You can run it either by:
1. Using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo new hello_project
   cd hello_project
   # Move hello.rs content into src/main.rs, then
   cargo run
   ```

2. Using `rustc`:
   ```bash
   rustc hello.rs
   ./hello    # On Windows: hello.exe
   ```

### Notes
- Cargo is better for managing dependencies and is generally recommended for larger projects.
- For quick tests and small scripts, `rustc` is simpler if you don’t need a full project structure.

### ⚙️ Configuration &amp; Hardware

- **Memory Requirements**: Rust is efficient, but at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for data processing tasks.
- **CPU Compatibility**: Ensure your system supports modern instructions (e.g., SSE4) for data processing with Polars.
- **Environment Variables**: Add Cargo to your PATH, typically done by Rustup during installation.

## ❓ FAQ

### Important Things to Remember While Using Rust
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust’s strict ownership model helps avoid memory errors. Check out the [Rust Ownership documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
- **Concurrency with Tokio**: Use the <code>#[tokio::main]</code> attribute for async functions and wrap I/O tasks in <code>tokio::spawn</code>.
- **Error Handling**: Rust uses <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types for error handling. [Anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/) and [ThisError](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) are also popular for structured error handling.
- **Macros and Pattern Matching**: Rust’s macros like <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> provide powerful control flows and are integral in clean error handling.

## 📈 Rust's Journey and Why It Matters for Data Engineers

### Rust's Development Over the Years
Since its initial release, Rust has grown rapidly, earning a reputation for performance and safety, and consistently topping developer surveys for most-loved language. As of now, Rust has reached a maturity level that makes it an ideal choice for system-level and high-performance applications, with key improvements in error handling, async programming, and stable libraries.

### Why Rust Is a Game-Changer for Data Engineers
Rust’s focus on performance, memory safety, and zero-cost abstractions makes it uniquely suited for data engineering:
1. **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Rust’s async model and Tokio library make it easy to handle large-scale data tasks.
2. **Reliability**: Rust’s strict compile-time checks minimize runtime errors, crucial for data integrity.
3. **Scalability**: Data engineers can build pipelines that handle increasing data loads with minimal memory footprint.

For data engineers who want to push the limits of efficiency and reliability, Rust offers tools to build pipelines that are faster, safer, and more scalable than traditional languages.
